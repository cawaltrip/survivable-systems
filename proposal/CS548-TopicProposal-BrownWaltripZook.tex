\section{Introduction}
For this project, the three of us have chosen to work on the first topic, addressing faults within assisted or self-driving vehicles.  Though two of us have done previous research on reliability issues of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) in a previous class that could prove useful for the other research topic, the amount of work that can be saved by all three of us with respect to the first topic was too much to pass up.

\section{Our Understanding of the Problem}
%\begin{Matt was here}
Our understanding of the problem is that we are tasked with identifying state-of-the-art research that discusses methods for evaluating value faults in the sensors of unmanned vehicles. We are not looking to devise new methods and algorithms that deal with value faults, rather research already proposed methods.  We hope to focus on recent research specifically to help speed the discovery of further research by presenting it in a concise method.

\section{Our Plan to Address Group Work}
For this project, we plan to meet at least weekly to share new research and ideas, and to divvy up work accordingly. The three of us have shared office space and a past working relationship, so we are likely to keep each other accountable and to share our workload equitably. However, group work can be tricky, so we will remain vigilant of that fact throughout our work. Since three of us will be working on this project, you can expect a longer and more in-depth paper than you would otherwise.
