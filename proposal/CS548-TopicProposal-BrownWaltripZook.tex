\begin{abstract}
	This paper is a survey of recent research that addresses the problem of sensor failure in autonomous vehicles. Modern mathematical and fault models are presented, and their strengths and weaknesses are assessed. In particular, we consider the different faults that should be assumed, as well as any real-time constraints that are imposed in the environment. This initial draft of our semester project includes highlights from information we have found so far and provides a roadmap for what direction we intend to go with our research.

\section{Research Highlights}

\subsection{Matt}
Unmanned vehicles have a much higher sensor count then manned vehicles. These sensors include proximity sensors, RADAR, LIDAR, and GPS. These sensors are deployed in networks that have to agree on input values so they can be process accurately. In order for these sensors to agree they need to be implemented redundantly. An agree method adapted from Yansong Ren and associates can be applied to this situation. In the algorithm proposed by Yansong Ren and associates they describe a set of redundant nodes that communicate through locally before broadcasting the results. If we adapt this algorithm to a real world sensor net the, a physically local group of sensors can be treated as a redundant group. This redundant group can agree on their readings via a majority algorithm or median agreement algorithm, to remove the readings of nodes in the group that read nothing. Once the sensor nodes have an agreed value they can pass the information to the main computer or processing module via multicast so all redundant nodes and the main processing module receive the same value. Through this method the transmitting node is held accountable to the value agreed.\cite{Ren2001}

Ren's paper also describes a method for removing or replacing faulting nodes. This method includes a manager that checks the value of the sent from the transmitting node to check for faulting. This method describes ``replacing" faulting nodes with new nodes. In a unmanned vehicle this method is not very practical. This idea can be adapted, however, to a module that can detect faulting modules that ``pushes" new copies of firmware to a faulting sensor in an attempt to repair it. This method fails however if a sensor is physically damaged.\cite{Ren2001}

Another aspect of redundancy that should be addressed is faulting nodes due to a failure in communication. If the communication system in a unmanned vehicle is designed to be self-repairing, through redundancy, it can take some time for the module to notice the failing path. In this case there needs to be a method for reintegrating sensors once communication is reestablished.
